## About

This small extension is meant to fix the missing setting that would allow avid users to go directly to the Subscriptions section of the YouTube website when clicking the logo. Great for anyone who wants to avoid the Home page by all means. Also redirects the "Home" menu item in the sidebar, or heck, any link that points to [https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/), no matter where it came from.

I used to maintain a userscript for this purpose, but due to YouTube's upcoming [Material redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/652obk/youtube_now_has_a_dark_mode_builtin/)'s use of [Polymer 2.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/) I simply couldn't work around their event handlers.

The `package` folder contains the exact contents of the ZIP file I upload to the CWS with each update.
